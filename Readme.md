Deployment contains the .war file and the folder deployed under ./htdocs/

Please follow the steps for configuration:

1) Copy paste Deployment/Client folder inside htdocs
	(The files are configured to run on local host )

2) Run Glass fish server and mount the war file 

3) The base url for the server is as follows
	http://localhost:8080/Project3/AppointmentsAPI/

If there is any changes in the URL (ie portnumber) ,please change the SERVER_PATH constant in ./assets/inc/page_start.inc.php file to reflect in the client


Thank you
